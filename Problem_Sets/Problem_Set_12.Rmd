In this problem set we are recreating a table from "Education, HIV, and Early Fertility: Experimental Evidence from Kenya" by Esther Duflo; Pascaline Dupas; Michael Kremer. Citation provided below:

Duflo, Esther, Pascaline Dupas, and Michael Kremer. 2015. "Education, HIV, and Early Fertility: Experimental Evidence from Kenya." American Economic Review, 105 (9): 2757-97

This paper explores whether education subsidies and/or the current HIV curriculum (focused fully on abstinence until marriage) have an effect on the dropout, pregnancy, marriage, and HIV (and other STI) rates of adolescent girls in Kenya.

We will be recreating Table 3 "Long-Run Impacts: Individual Long-Term Follow-Up Survey Data (After seven years)" from this paper.

This table is created using the model:
$$Y_{is} = \beta_0 + β_1S_s + \beta_2H_s + \beta_3SH_s + X_s'μ + \epsilon_{is}$$

### Description of Variables in Model:

$Y_{is}$ is the outcome for student $i$ enrolled in school $s$ at baseline. We are only interested in replicating $Y_{is}$ for reached eight grade and grades completed. 

$S_s$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 for schools with stand-alone education subsidy

$H_s$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 for schools with  stand-alone HIV education program

$SH_S$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 for schools with education subsidy and HIV education program

$X_s$ is a vector of school-level controls (timing of the data collection, school size, and randomization stratum). Therefore, $X_s$ is school fixed effects.

$\epsilon_{is}$ are errors terms that are assumed to be independent across schools. 

Standard errors are clustered at school level.

### Replication

We are going to replicate the first two regression models for females from table 3. The first model has the response variable reached 8th grade while the second model has the response variable grade completed. The reached 8th grade variable is an indicator variable while the grade completed variable is a continuous variable representing years of schooling. We provide one of the linear hypothesis tests as well, specifically where the null hypothesis is beta coefficient of the stand-alone education subsidy program is equal to the beta coefficient of the stand-alone HIV education program.

mod1 <- lm(reached_8 ~ Uonly + Honly + UH + factor(yrbirth) + factor(Q_year) + schsize + factor(stratum), data = females, weights = weight_sample)

head(round(coef_test(mod1, vcov = ClusV),3),4)

### Grades Completed Females as Response

```{r}
