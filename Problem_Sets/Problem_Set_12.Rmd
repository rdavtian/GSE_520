In this problem set we are recreating a table from "Education, HIV, and Early Fertility: Experimental Evidence from Kenya" by Esther Duflo; Pascaline Dupas; Michael Kremer. Citation provided below:

Duflo, Esther, Pascaline Dupas, and Michael Kremer. 2015. "Education, HIV, and Early Fertility: Experimental Evidence from Kenya." American Economic Review, 105 (9): 2757-97

This paper explores whether education subsidies and/or the current HIV curriculum (focused fully on abstinence until marriage) have an effect on the dropout, pregnancy, marriage, and HIV (and other STI) rates of adolescent girls in Kenya.

We will be recreating Table 3 "Long-Run Impacts: Individual Long-Term Follow-Up Survey Data (After seven years)" from this paper.

This table is created using the model:
$$Y_{is} = \beta_0 + β_1S_s + \beta_2H_s + \beta_3SH_s + \beta_4Age_i + X_s'μ + \epsilon_{is}$$

Description of variables in model:

$Y_{is}$ is the outcome for student $i$ enrolled in school $s$ at baseline

$Y_{is}$ changes between being all of the following variables:
= Reached eighth grade
= Grades completed
= Ever married
= Ever pregnant
= Ever pregnant but never married
= Ever married but never pregnant
= Had started childbearing by age 16


$S_s$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 for schools with stand-alone education subsidy

$H_s$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 for schools with  stand-alone HIV education program

$SH_S$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 for schools with education subsidy and HIV education program

$Age_i$ is the age of student $i$

$X_s$ is a vector of school-level controls (timing of the data collection, school size, and randomization stratum). Therefore, $X_s$ is school fixed effects.

$\epsilon_{is}$ are errors terms that are assumed to be independent across schools. 

Standard errors are clustered at school level.
